Spree 3PLCentral
================

Introduction goes here.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_3plcentral', github: 'cehdeti/spree_3plcentral', branch: 'master'
  ```

2. This gem relies on the [`3pl_central`](https://github.com/adamrunner/3pl_central) gem, which is not published to rubygems, so you'll need to add that to your `Gemfile` too:
  ```ruby
  gem '3pl_central', github: 'adamrunner/3pl_central'
  ```

3. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

4. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_3plcentral:install
  ```

5. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_3plcentral/factories'
```
